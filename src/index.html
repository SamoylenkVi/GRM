            <b>Key Takeaways</b>
            <ul class="list--tick">
                <li>Commodity prices will only go up. Inflation is real and continues to deteriorate wealth</li>
                <li>Inflation effect can be hedged by inflation protection strategies</li>
                <li>Strategies are live and show significant evidence to work</li>
                <li>5% allocation covers the downside of a portfolio of up to 25% p.a. due inflation and markets</li>

                    <p>Over the past two years we have seen events fueling inflation: COVID-19, money printing, geopolitical events. We expect high inflation levels to continue over the coming months and years.</p>
                    <p>Figure 1 shows the long-term commodities cycle over decades. In 2019 commodity prices have stabilized after a 10 years price depreciation (see the orange line).</p>
                    <p>During the pandemic period, in 2020-2022, and in present times, we can observe the continuation of disruptions of supply chains and imbalances in supply and demand.</p>
                    <p>We believe these circumstances are the start point for the reversal of the commodity price trend. We expect an appreciation of commodity prices for the periods ahead of us (see dotted blue line in graph).</p>

                <li>
                    <b>Increase of commodities’ prices</b>
                    <p>Increase of&nbsp;commodities prices is&nbsp;the catalyst of&nbsp;higher inflation. This estimate is&nbsp;based on&nbsp;the transition of&nbsp;the historical graph of&nbsp;the cost of&nbsp;commodities for 200 years into a&nbsp;growth phase. Therefore, we&nbsp;expect a&nbsp;general increase in&nbsp;the commodities&rsquo; prices in&nbsp;the next 30&nbsp;years.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Imbalances in supply and demand</b>
                    <p>During the pandemic, and in&nbsp;present times we&nbsp;can observe the continuation of&nbsp;disruptions of&nbsp;supply chains and imbalances in&nbsp;supply and demand. However, as&nbsp;economies and societies returned to&nbsp;normal, it&nbsp;was discovered that supply was lagging behind the boom in&nbsp;demand. This factor led to&nbsp;an&nbsp;increased burden on&nbsp;suppliers and producers, which drove prices&nbsp;up.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Geopolitical turbulence</b>
                    <p>Since 2022, the world has faced a&nbsp;worsening geopolitical crisis that has inevitably put the existence of&nbsp;the global economy into question. Increasing conflicts between countries lead to&nbsp;the market fragmentation, which aggravates the imbalance of&nbsp;different resources in&nbsp;the market.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Inflation begets inflation</b>
                    <p>Rising prices are a source of high inflation going forward. We assume that prices will only rise and that cash will depreciate at an increasing rate. As of spring 2022, we are experiencing the highest inflation rates in 40 years, which is an unbiased confirmation of our prognosis.</p>
